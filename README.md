## 🧠 Description

Why?
We were involved in a couple of NGO's and NPO's and noticed that, while these organizations buy "professional" Email Accounts and CRM's/ERP's for their needs, money for an Email-Sending Tool is usually not spent because of the expensiveness of these tools (cost & benefit). Therefore, we (and probably many others) need(ed) to export the contacts from the CRM/ERP as csv file and copy paste the desired data into our Email-Client individually by hand. This not only took/takes an unnecessary amount of time, but also leaves no room for customization. Our tool solves all the problems described above.

How?
With the Bulkmail-Builder, you can send up to 1000 Emails (depending on your Email-Provider) at once, by:
1. Stating your information such as Email-Provider, Email-Adress and your Password.
2. Upload a csv-file with your desired recipients. It's best to have at least the Email-Adress and Name of these stated in the file.
3. Write your subject and text. Here, you can use all columns present in the file as variables (e.g. state the first name in the greeting automatically). Optionally, you can also add an attachment (up to 5MB).

We DO NOT save any of this data.
